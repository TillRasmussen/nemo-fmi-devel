Support
=======

| First of all, :forge:`search <search on the developement platform>` in the most comprehensive way 
  (wiki, tickets, forum and online doc) to check if the subject has not already been discussed.
| If you found no answer after that, create the corresponding ressource online according to your need

- Question: create a topic in the appropriate :forge:`discussion <forum>`
- Issue: open a new ticket of the right type depending of its severity
  - "Unavoidable" :forge:`newticket?type=Bug       <bug>`
  - "Workable"    :forge:`newticket?type=Defect <defect>`

Please follow the guidelines and also be as specific as possible for the ticket description.

New development
===============

You have developed something related to the NEMO project: a personal configuration, 
an addition of the source code, a full fork of the reference, a {pre,post}-processing tool, ...
Done initially for your own purpose, you believe your work is of interest for the community.
You can report it in different ways depending on your motivation and your willingness to 
see it included in the NEMO shared reference.

Beforehand, you should know that the NEMO Developers Committee will decide 
if the development is relevant and useful. 
First criteria will be of course the scientific interest, 
but the amount of work needed to successfully meet the quality control requirements is also going to be evaluated.

Hack
----

You're not ready to do more other than to inform other users of your development, 
you can promote your work by creating a specific topic on this :forge:`discussion/forum/5 <dedicated forum>` 
which brings together all the contributions from the community.

Proposal / Task
---------------

| You can suggest a :forge:`newticket?type=Enhancement <enhancement>` to be made which can be supplemented by 
  the output of ``svn diff`` from your working copy 
  (easier for integration with ``svn patch`` than the attachement of modified routines).
| But without a little more work, 

If you really think your development worths the integration into the NEMO shared reference, 
your ticket should describe the development and its implementation, so as the existing validations.

Once the approval of Developers Committee is given, 
the development can be added to the yearly development work plan.
From there you will be in charge of an development action, 
with the perspective of merging it by the end of civil year, 
but also with the help of NEMO System Team to follow the different development steps.
